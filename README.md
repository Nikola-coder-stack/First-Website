Hey hey
My name is Nikola and this is my first website that i have ever built.
I've used HTML + CSS and did some JS ( For now ).
So far I also managed to make it responsive as much as I could but still there is need for improvement.
I will keep updating it and next on the lsit is to do try out some animations and add functionallity via JS (I dont know yet).
